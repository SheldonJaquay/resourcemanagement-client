# Lithnet FIM/MIM Service Client

The library has a similar purpose to the [FIM 2010 Client](https://fim2010client.codeplex.com/), but abstracts away the peculiars of the web service implementation into a robust object model. The development of the FIM 2010 client was abandoned some time ago and unfortunately, the client suffers from a number of bugs and performance issues. This library is *not* intended to be a drop-in replacement for that library. It is a complete re-write with a new API and more approachable way of working with the objects in the FIM service.
